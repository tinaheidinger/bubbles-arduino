# Project 2 - Arduino + Processing

## Software

* Arduino 1.6.5
* Processing 3
* Arduino library for Pololu L3G boards https://github.com/pololu/l3g-arduino

## Project Description

We implemented bubbles that bounce towards their gravity. The gravity direction can be adjusted with a gyroscope that is attached to an arduino.

## Sources

* Basic bouncy bubbles example https://processing.org/examples/bouncybubbles.html

## Custom-built parts

* Changing the gravity direction
* Reading the analog output from the gyroscope and depending the gravity direction on the output
* Fancy colors and different bubble transparency
